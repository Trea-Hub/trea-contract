# Trea Contract

Smart contract powering **Trea**, an event registration and ticketing platform built on **Stellar** and **Soroban**. This repo contains only the on-chain logic — registration, payment escrow, refunds, and attendance check-in. The backend and frontend live in separate repos.

> Status: core contract logic implemented and unit tested against a local Soroban test environment. Testnet deployment is the next step.

---

## Why Soroban

- **Payments** settle fast and cheap on Stellar — useful for ticket sales, especially across borders.
- Registration, payment, and refund logic run in a single auditable contract instead of a backend database anyone with server access could quietly edit.
- Funds are **escrowed in the contract** at registration time and only released to the organizer via an explicit `payout` call — refunds don't depend on the organizer being online or willing to co-sign every request.

## What this contract does

- **Event creation** — organizers set price (or free), payment token, capacity, and refund policy per event.
- **Registration with escrow** — paid registrations transfer funds into the contract, not directly to the organizer.
- **Refunds** — either the attendee (if the organizer allows self-refund, optionally before a deadline) or the organizer (anytime, as an override) can trigger a refund.
- **Check-in / attendance verification** — organizers mark attendees as checked in on-chain.
- **Payout** — organizer withdraws escrowed funds from the contract after the event.

All state-changing calls require on-chain authorization (`require_auth()`) from the relevant address — nobody can register, refund, or check in on behalf of someone else without their signature, except the organizer's explicit overrides described below.

## Contract reference

Contract: `EventRegistration` — `contracts/registration/src/lib.rs`

| Function | Caller | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `create_event(organizer, event_id, price, token, capacity, self_refund_allowed, refund_deadline)` | organizer | Registers a new event. `price = 0` marks it free. `refund_deadline = 0` means no deadline on self-refunds. |
| `register(attendee, event_id)` | attendee | Registers for an event. If `price > 0`, transfers payment from the attendee into contract escrow. |
| `refund(caller, event_id, attendee)` | attendee or organizer | Refunds an attendee from escrow. Self-refund requires `self_refund_allowed` and (if set) must be before `refund_deadline`. Organizer can always refund. |
| `check_in(organizer, event_id, attendee)` | organizer | Marks an attendee as checked in. |
| `payout(organizer, event_id)` | organizer | Withdraws the event's escrowed balance to the organizer. |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) v1.84.0 or higher
- The `wasm32v1-none` target: `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli): `cargo install --locked stellar-cli`

### Build and test

```bash
cd contracts/registration
cargo test              # run unit tests
stellar contract build  # build the .wasm artifact
```

The built contract is output to `target/wasm32v1-none/release/registration.wasm`.

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
stellar keys generate --global trea-deployer --network testnet --fund
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/registration.wasm \
  --source trea-deployer \
  --network testnet
```

This returns a contract ID you can call directly via the CLI or wire up to a frontend.

## Upgrade and migration strategy

We use an upgradeable contract strategy rather than a destructive `immutable + redeploy` model. Soroban contracts keep persistent storage under the same contract ID across code upgrades, so event records remain intact as long as the storage keys remain compatible. The migration plan is documented in [docs/upgrades.md](./docs/upgrades.md).

## Roadmap

- [x] Core contract: create event, register, refund, check-in, payout
- [x] Unit test coverage for auth paths, escrow, and refund policy branches
- [ ] Testnet deployment + CLI walkthrough
- [ ] Security review before Mainnet
