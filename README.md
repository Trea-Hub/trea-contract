# Trea Contract

Smart contract powering **Trea**, an event registration and ticketing platform built on **Stellar** and **Soroban**. This repo contains only the on-chain logic — registration, payment escrow, refunds, and attendance check-in. The backend and frontend live in separate repos.

> Status: core contract logic implemented and unit tested against a local Soroban test environment. Testnet deployment is the next step.

---

## Why Soroban

- **Payments** settle fast and cheap on Stellar — useful for ticket sales, especially across borders.
- Registration, payment, and refund logic run in a single auditable contract instead of a backend database anyone with server access could quietly edit.
- Funds are **escrowed in the contract** at registration time and only released to the organizer via an explicit `payout` call — refunds don't depend on the organizer being online or willing to co-sign every request.

## What this contract does

- **Event creation** — organizers set price (or free), payment token, capacity, and refund policy per event.
- **Registration with escrow** — paid registrations transfer funds into the contract, not directly to the organizer.
- **Refunds** — either the attendee (if the organizer allows self-refund, optionally before a deadline) or the organizer (anytime, as an override) can trigger a refund.
- **Check-in / attendance verification** — organizers mark attendees as checked in on-chain.
- **Payout** — organizer withdraws escrowed funds from the contract after the event.

All state-changing calls require on-chain authorization (`require_auth()`) from the relevant address — nobody can register, refund, or check in on behalf of someone else without their signature, except the organizer's explicit overrides described below.

## Contract reference

Contract: `EventRegistration` — `contracts/registration/src/lib.rs`

See [docs/resource-usage.md](./docs/resource-usage.md) for storage operation
counts and the optimized duplicate check-in path. See
[docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for the storage-key structure
proposal and compatibility considerations.

| Function | Caller | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `create_event(organizer, event_id, price, token, capacity, self_refund_allowed, refund_deadline)` | organizer | Registers a new event. `price = 0` marks it free. `refund_deadline = 0` means no deadline on self-refunds. |
| `register(attendee, event_id)` | attendee | Registers for an event. If `price > 0`, transfers payment from the attendee into contract escrow. |
| `refund(caller, event_id, attendee)` | attendee or organizer | Refunds an attendee from escrow. Self-refund requires `self_refund_allowed` and (if set) must be before `refund_deadline`. Organizer can always refund. |
| `check_in(organizer, event_id, attendee)` | organizer | Marks a registered attendee as checked in; walk-ins are rejected. |
| `payout(organizer, event_id)` | organizer | Withdraws the event's escrowed balance to the organizer. |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) v1.84.0 or higher
- The `wasm32v1-none` target: `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli): `cargo install --locked stellar-cli`

### Build and test

```bash
cd contracts/registration
cargo test              # run unit tests
stellar contract build  # build the .wasm artifact
```

The built contract is output to `target/wasm32v1-none/release/registration.wasm`.

### Local network end-to-end test

The unit tests use Soroban's in-memory `Env`. To exercise deployment and real CLI
transactions against a local Stellar network, use the PowerShell script:

```powershell
.\scripts\local-network-e2e.ps1
```

Prerequisites:

- Stellar CLI 26 or newer (`stellar --version`)
- Rust and the `wasm32v1-none` target (see prerequisites above)
- Docker running, with host port `8000` available
- PowerShell 5.1 or newer

The script starts a named local Stellar container, creates temporary CLI
configuration and funded organizer/attendee identities, builds and deploys the
registration contract and native asset contract, then invokes `create_event`,
`register`, and `refund` through the CLI. The event charges one XLM and allows
self-refunds, so the flow exercises escrow transfers. It stops the container
that it started and removes the temporary CLI configuration when finished.

The script does not modify your normal Stellar CLI configuration or identities.
If it exits before completing, inspect the CLI error; the container is stopped
and temporary configuration is removed in either case.

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
stellar keys generate --global trea-deployer --network testnet --fund
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/registration.wasm \
  --source trea-deployer \
  --network testnet
```

This returns a contract ID you can call directly via the CLI or wire up to a frontend.

## Upgrade and migration strategy

We use an upgradeable contract strategy rather than a destructive `immutable + redeploy` model. Soroban contracts keep persistent storage under the same contract ID across code upgrades, so event records remain intact as long as the storage keys remain compatible. The migration plan is documented in [docs/upgrades.md](./docs/upgrades.md).

## Roadmap

- [x] Core contract: create event, register, refund, check-in, payout
- [x] Unit test coverage for auth paths, escrow, and refund policy branches
- [ ] Testnet deployment + CLI walkthrough
- [ ] Security review before Mainnet
